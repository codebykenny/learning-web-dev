# Learning NodeJS + Web Dev
---
This is an opinionated approach to learning how to get started with NodeJS and Web Development. The goal of this project is to curate a list of tutorials and guides to help along the process of learning how to start your very own web server written in Node and get a front-end working so that you can start a website.

This guide is intended for people who have very little experience with Node projects and will aim to teach the little intricacies for beginners.
